# Video Understanding & Question-Answering System

## Overview
This repository contains a video understanding and question-answering system capable of:
- Detecting objects in video frames
- Recognizing actions using VideoMAE
- Answering both descriptive and multiple-choice questions based on video content
- Handling large videos efficiently with GPU-optimized batch processing

The system is built with FastAPI for serving the API and Groq LLM for reasoning.

## Features
- **Object Detection**: YOLOv8x-based detection across sampled frames
- **Action Recognition**: VideoMAE-based classification
- **Scene Summary Generation**: Combines object and action information
- **QA Support**: Answers descriptive and MCQs
- **Batch Processing**: Optimized GPU usage
- **Memory-Safe**: Works for videos of any length

## Architecture Diagram

**Flow:**
1. Video input ‚Üí Frame extraction (Decord/OpenCV)
2. Object detection on sampled frames (YOLOv8x)
3. Action recognition (VideoMAE)
4. Scene summary generation
5. Question answering via Groq API (MCQ or descriptive)
6. Return answer in plain text via FastAPI
